# Changelog

## [0.5.7] - 2026-06-30

- Removed non-working **Hide to tray** button (minimize and close already go to tray)

### Fixed
- Status hero no longer stuck on "Starting…" — inline bridge poll + refresh on tray restore
- Minimize (−) sends window to tray instead of the taskbar (v0.5.6)
- Tauri command ACL permissions for bridge/UI invoke (v0.5.6)
- `poll-handoff.ps1` auto-restarts Grok Link when bridge drops during long waits

## [0.5.6] - 2026-06-30

### Fixed
- Minimize button hides to tray (not taskbar)
- Status hero updates via HTTP + Tauri; refreshes when window restored from tray
